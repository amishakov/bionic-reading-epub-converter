This is a very rudimentary epub converter, but it will probably get things done. 

Usage:
```python brec.py myepubbook.epub```

The result would be a "bionic_myepubbook.epub" file and a "myepubbook.epub_zip" folder (this one you can delete or explore)


[Bionic Reading](https://bionic-reading.com/) allegedly  helps you read faster and read in general (or at all) if you have some type of struggles in this field.

### Updates

Probably a less "rudimentary" new version, but it remains to be seen.

Usage:

```
pytnon brec_v2.py input.epub output.epub 
```
